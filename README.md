- ⚡ Fun facts: Before diving into the tech world, I spent years studying animal nutrition, behavior and welfare, and I can tell you some fascinating stories about animal intelligence!
      I grew up in Zimbabwe, where there is an abundance of natural wonders including the Safari animals known as the big 5 (elephants, lions, leopards, rhinos, and buffalo) as well as other notable wildlife, the thunderous Victoria falls (world's greatest sheet of falling water), Mutarazi falls, which is the highest waterfalls in the country,
      Lake Kariba (world's largest artificial lake by volume) to mention but a few!! So I feel blessed to have ended up in Canada, which also has an abundance of natural resources including the rugged coastlines of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans to the vast boreal forests, pristine lakes, and the iconic Canadian Rocky Mountains
      and unrivalled phenomena such as the Northern Lights. If it does not show in these few sentences; I love travelling and experiencing the beauty which every place has to offer!
